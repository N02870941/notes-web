# Notes
This is the accompanying website for The Note App. This website contains the
privacy policy and support pages for the Note App that is available
via the Apple App Store. The site is written in ReactJS, and is developed with a serverless
architecture in mind - namely, Firebase. This repo leverages Firebase hosting,
Firebase cloud functions, and Travis CI to employ a full Continuous Integration
and Continuous Deployment pipeline. Deployments occur on push events to the `master` branch.
